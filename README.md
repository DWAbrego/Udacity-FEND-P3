for self-checking their submission.


To Play:

Initially the game will be paused.  Press Start to begin.  The bugs will move, and you move your player with
the arrow keys.  Your goal is to guide the player from the initial position (bottom left) to the top of the page
where the water is drawn.

NOTE:  On Firefox browser, you first need to click on the grid to set focus.  This must be
done before you begin to play.

If the player collides with a bug, he is sent back to the initial starting position.

If you can successfully guide the player to the water at the top of the page, you score 100 points, and the
player starts again.

You can pause the game at any time by pressing 'Pause.'

You can reset the player by pressing 'Reset Player.'  This places the player back at the starting position,
resets the score to 0, and pauses the game.  Press 'Start' to begin again.
